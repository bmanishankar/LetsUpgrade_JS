Question : Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.
Answer:
var - It is used to create variables and that are definitely to be defined.
let - It allows user to create variables that need not to be assigned in declaration. Mostly let is used in block of codes to distinguish variable from gloabal scope
const - Once a variable is defined as const it can't be changed to new value. But new values can be appended.

var name="ManiSankar" // It works absolutely fine
var name; // It throws Error since it is not assigned to any value

let name; // No Error

const shapes={"Triangle","Square","Rectange"}
const shapes="Cuboid" // Throws Error

shapes.push("Pentagon") // Works fine without throwing any errors
